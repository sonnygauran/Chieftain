= Chieftain =

Chieftain is an Integrated Library System (ILS) developed
for the initial use of Arellano University - Jose Abad
Santos (JAS) Campus. Chieftain is expected to perform on a
daily basis by reading values from 2D Barcodes for transactions.
Scanning patrons, books, and checkouts/returns can normally be
accomplished with just the use of one barcode scanner and w/o the 
aid of a keyboard. Included as well is a utility for producing PDFs
for printing more barcodes for patrons and books.
